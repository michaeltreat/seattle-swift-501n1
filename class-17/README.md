# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 17 - GoGoGitHub  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIKit to build out an application to help work towards a better understanding of Apple's primary UI framework.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement OAuth to authenticate my users with GitHub.  
 - As a user, I want to be able to view and search through my repositories on GitHub.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement a UISearchBar into my application, to show the delegation pattern and allow the user to search their repositories by name.  

## Technical Requirements  
* Add the	`GitHub` logo, located in the lecture directory above, to your assets and place it on the `GitHubAuthController` in storyboard, with the following constraints:  
	* Center Horizontally in container
	* Center Vertically in container
	* Width: 200
	* Height: 200
* Your AppDelegate should check to see if token exists before making a call to Github. If token does not exist, present login screen.  
* Implement the ability fetch repositories using a GET request.
	* NOTE: Make sure you include "repo" in your initial scope when requesting a token.  
* Create model object for `Repository` with a failable `init` that takes in a user `json` dictionary and initializes a `Repository` instance. The `Repository` class should have the following members:  
   	* name: String  
	* description: String?  
	* language: String?  
* Parse through the JSON returned from the server into `Repository` objects.  
* Create `RepoViewController` to display all the user's repositories in a TableView. 
	* Each cell can just display the name of the repository for today.  

### Stretch Goals  
* Implement a `UISearchBar` on your `UITableView`, to search the user's repositories based on repo name.  
	* Upon clicking the search button, your tableView should reload its data, and only display the repos that meet the searchTerm.
