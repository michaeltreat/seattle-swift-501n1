# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 16 - GoGoGitHub  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIKit to build out an application to help work towards a better understanding of Apple's primary UI framework.  
 - As a developer, I want to use redirect URL's, to allow iOS devices to redirect users into my application from other applications.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement OAuth into my applications, to provide security to my users when authenticating with different web API's.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement saving to UserDefaults, to allow my user's to persist quick bits of data to the device.  

## Technical Requirements  
 * New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine  
 * Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history  
 * Implement a custom URL Scheme to allow other applications to redirect into your application.
 * Implement an OAuth workflow in your app that successfully lets the user authenticate with your app.
 * Implement UserDefaults, for today, to store the `access_token`, so the user only needs to go through the OAuth process once.
 * On launch, your application needs to check if there is an existing `access_token` in UserDefaults. If there is, disable the login button. 
 
 **PROJECT WEEK(prepared for class tomorrow)**:
  * Come up with an approximately 1 minute Project Pitch for class tomorrow:  
    * Preliminary name for the application  
    * The primary features of the applicaiton(what potential frameworks, libraries, functionality).  
    * What problem does this idea solve?  
    * Who is the primary user?  

## Submitting Your Assignment  

1. When your work is complete and ready for submission, **open a Pull Request** from `class-16-lab` to `master`.
