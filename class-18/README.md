# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 18 - GoGoGitHub  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIKit to build out an application to help work towards a better understanding of Apple's primary UI framework.  
 - As a user, I want to be able to click on a repository to see more of the details associated with that specific repository.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement a custom transition into my application to create a "delightful" UX.  
 - As a developer, I want to implement my `UITableViewCell`'s as `UINibs` to have a more easily reusable cell and to provide more data to the user than the default cell styles allow.  

## Technical Requirements  
* Layout your TableViewCells as Nibs and create a subclass called `RepositoryCell` instead of using the Basic UITableViewCell.  
* Your Nib should have `UILabels` for 3 pieces of data from the Repository:  
	* Repo Name  
	* Repo Description  
	* Repo Language  
* Create `RepoDetailViewController` that will display Repository information.  
* Implement the dismissal of the `RepoDetailViewController`.  
* Your `RepoDetailViewController` should display at least these 6 pieces of data from the Repository:  
    * Repo Name  
    * Repo Description  
    * Programming Language  
    * Number Of Stars  
    * isFork: True or False  
    * createdAt: Date  
* Create custom `UIViewController` Transition from HomeViewController to `RepoDetailViewController`.
