# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 11 - PicFeed  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIKit to build out an application to help work towards a better understanding of Apple's primary UI framework.  
 - As a developer, I want to use CloudKit in my applications, to allow user's to store and share data stored in the cloud.  
 - As a developer, I want to use UIImagePickerController, to allow user's to be able to access the photos stored on their device.  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize UIAlertController, to be able to present meaningful alerts and quick bits of information to the user.  

## Technical Requirements  
 * Create a new repository properly set up with a license, README, and `.gitignore`, and clone to local machine  
 * Working on a non-master branch, called `class-11-lab`, with regular commit history  
 * Enable CloudKit in your applications *Capabilities*, we will continue to build this out tomorrow.  
 * Layout an `imageView` in the center of the screen using Auto Layout and give it a placeholder image.
   	* The placeholder image should be added to the asset catalog and should have all appropriate sizes added(1x,2x,3x).  
 * In the attributes inspector, make sure to enable *Clips to Bounds* and set the content mode to *Aspect Fill* on the `imageView`.  
 * `UIImageView` Auto Layout Constraints:  
 	* centerX  
	* centerY  
	* width 0.75  
	* height 0.75  
 * Create an outlet to your image view in code called `imageView`.  
 * Add a TapGestureRecognizer to the image view and create a corresponding `Action` in code.  
 * When tapped the image should present a UIAlertController to allow the user to select the *Camera* or *Photo Library*  
 * Use the UIImagePickerController and its delegate to use the camera to set the image view's image.  
 
### Stretch Goal:  
 * Your UIImagePickerController should allow editing. Also, the *edited* image should be assigned to the image view.  
 * Write a function that takes in a sentence as a String and determines how many words there are in it.
